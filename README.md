# receptacle-smtp-server
A smtp server unconditionally accepts any incoming messages

## Target
This product is to create a simple SMTP server without any validation. It serves as the gate of a mail delivery system. 

## Credit
The initial code of this project is branched from [fake-smtp-server](https://github.com/gessnerfl/fake-smtp-server/tree/2.3.0) v2.3.0. 
I've changed the package names to match with my other products but many thanks to the original authors.
